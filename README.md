# TILE TRIAL
## A Memory Game

### INSTRUCTIONS

There are sixteen tiles on the board. When you start the game, five random tiles will flip. Click the same tiles and you gain a point! When you hit ten points, you win.

### GAME INFO

This game was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

You can view my original wireframes <a href="tile-trial-wireframes">here.</a>

In the future, I would like to include several levels that get harder each time.

### PLAY

<p>Play the game <a href="https://maddyrombes.github.io/tile-trial/">here!</a></p>

You can play it on your phone, too! I would like to implement a more responsive design.
